Introduction
============

This documentation outlines the usage, operational procedures, and validation strategy for the Illumina DRAGEN Bio-IT Platform v3.8 DNA pipeline.

The DRAGEN platform provides hardware-accelerated solutions for fast, accurate secondary analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. It supports a wide range of bioinformatics workflows, including read quality control (QC), read alignment to a reference genome, variant calling for SNVs and CNVs, and structural variant detection.

This guide is organized into two major sections:

- **SOP (Standard Operating Procedures)**: Step-by-step operational instructions for executing various stages of the pipeline.
- **SVP (Standard Validation Procedures)**: Guidelines and quality benchmarks for validating pipeline performance.

This documentation is intended for QA engineers, clinical bioinformaticians, and technical stakeholders responsible for validation, reproducibility, and quality assurance of bioinformatics workflows.
